## Hi Iâ€™m Zac, the owner of ZENVENT.

I have a passion for technology. I write software by day, and tinker with hardware by night.

I am a maker. Construction, prototyping, and programming peak my interest. I invest heavily in robotics such as CNC machining, 3D printing, and laser fabrication. Electronic parts and unfinished experiments litter my home. 

ZENVENT is a company and domain that I created to publish and sell my work.

Thanks for stopping by.
