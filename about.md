## Hi I’m Zac, the owner of ZENVENT.

I have a passion for technology. I write software by day, and solder hardware by night. My obsession with electronics is what drives me to write better software and build better hardware.

I’m a software developer, machinist, carpenter, artist(?), and in general jack of all trades (and master of none). I like to play with all the new shiny new electronic devices out there, because I love to think I’m staying on top of technology.

ZENVENT is a company and domain that I created in order to publish and sell my work.

Thanks for stopping by.
