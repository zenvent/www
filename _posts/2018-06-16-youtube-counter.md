I designed a YouTube subscriber counter for the ESP8266. It drives a 4-digit 7 segment display and updates regularly (over wifi).
The TV case was designed in TinkerCAD (online) then exported as STL. It can be 3D printed in two halves and glued together.
The 'screen' is simply acrylic with metallic spray paint on the back- this gives the effect of static noise and is also semi-transparent to allow the LED lights through.

I uploaded the model to Thingiverse:
