Unsatisfied with the Tesla app in terms of convenience, I created a Wear OS app for Tesla.

With Tezz you can control your Tesla on your Wear OS device. The simple user interface makes for quick and easy access to common functions of your Tesla. 

Control with just one tap:
* Door locks
* Fronk & Trunk
* Automated Climate

Get notifications
* Open door warnings
* Car unlocked
* Sunroof open
* Climate Status
