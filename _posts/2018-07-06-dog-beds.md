Cheap and easy to build dog beds. They have a modern/contemporary look. Can be built to match any existing furniture textures and colors.

### Parts List
* Scrap hardwood for legs
* Few sheets of chip board (sold as shelves)
* Some thin batting
* Fabric/Linen Curtains
* Black Paint
* Iron Angles

To make the process easier I upholstered each piece first, then used the iron angle to attach them all together. Use clamps to keep everything at 90 degrees. To stiffen the frame I attached a solid sheet of 1/4 MDF to the base. This will prevent the mattress from sagging and add most of the structural support.
